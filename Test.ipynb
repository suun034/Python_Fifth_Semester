    "1. Optimisation\n",
    "This is the process of finding the best solution or the most efficient way to solve a problem from a set of possible solutions. It involves finding the maximum or minimum value of a function, subject to certain constraints or conditions.\n",
    "Types of Optimisation:\n",
    "* Constrained Optimisation: Involves finding the optimum solution within a set of constraints, such as equations or inequalities that the solution must satisfy.\n",
    "* Unconstrained Optimisation: Involves finding the optimum solution without any constraints, where the variables can take any value.\n",
    "* Linear Optimisation: Involves a linear objective function and linear constraints, where both the objective function and constraints are linear equations.\n",
    "* Non-Linear Optimisation: Involves an objective function or constraints that are non-linear, making the problem more complex to solve.\n",
    "* Discrete Optimisation: Involves variables that can only take on discrete values, often integers, common in scenarios like scheduling and resource allocation."
